[000:00.000][A]: welcome to the a16z podcast
[000:03.409][A]: I'm Michael Copeland and I'm here with Benedict Evans
[000:07.497][A]: who's actually just joined Andreessen Horowitz recently
[000:10.646][A]: who got away from London
[000:12.119][A]: he's a long-time mobile and then another round smartphone
[000:15.586][A]: Panic welcome
[000:16.742][B]: great to be here like $0.16
[000:19.205][A]: bad as they say
[000:22.108][B]: Mexican band name that said talk
[000:25.098][A]: are you have to start the band
[000:27.604][A]: I'm talking about mobile would you like to talk about and think about
[000:32.978][A]: there's been a lot of sort of Windows OS Windows mobile sort of news out recently out of Mobile World Congress but it's the war for the mobile OS already over
[000:46.614][B]: I'm sure they'll say yes it's okay what that means
[000:53.043][B]: inasmuch as Apple has about 12 in the launch quarter they have about 10% of all the phones sold enough and Android has another 45 to 50 Cent Hold only about two-thirds of those Google Android and once I have been trying to and I have any Google services and the remaining hopeful that about to the flea market will convert over the next year for his two friends one expresses old don't be a kind of a residue of five or 10% of people agreed upon for them
[001:22.251][A]: 
[001:22.554][B]: Friday night should be interesting question is how many people have it and affordable data plan rather than how many people have a fan running unit sold some of the operating system
[001:30.918][B]: rule of Amazing Grace is going to be like this you have to be a $50 or $75 so I felt it
[001:37.079][B]: and there's a little bit of skin itching around the edges yes so you can follow them and playing one of other countries as well as one side
[001:46.302][B]: and you have Microsoft Windows phone when she's not being combined with Nokia E7 in very small numbers in a sudden number of middle income in Emerging Markets exclusively every life crisis so if you don't care to ask me that really only fair that only selling the letter inside is there any color in the fall but she was like I told her that I didn't take time
[002:10.751][B]: random and they will have to give them Geographic sells anything anything I was 800000 units in the USA loss corset
[002:19.173][B]: so if all the opportunity in the balls around the big fat butts with the great cameras nobody out of his body that devices sold when it's time to have sex and people are giving you don't even really treating this offense
[002:31.480][B]: so you know that may change into some interesting things around with Microsoft my day with that will know he is trying to do with Android
[002:38.811][B]: but the cool thing is that you have always seen you have an Android and then you have people building stuff on top of Android to a greater or lesser extent for the best
[002:47.998][B]: the Chinese are using stock Android but no using Google cuz it's a Google in China or whether it's Amazon to build a tablet and a full rebuild and find out on their own custom filtration of Android and I don't care I'm going to freshen up and all is well
[003:00.963][B]: but not so much like him I didn't know it's like looking at the second world war when talking about he's going to beat the Italians
[003:10.215][A]: 
[003:11.407][B]: penis
[003:13.263][A]: 
[003:13.653][B]: the the for practical purposes we have to substantiate ecosystem
[003:20.038][B]: and you know how things play out with a countdown I'm actually only going to change in the next two to three years
[003:25.845][B]: we will end up with seven eight nine hundred million iOS devices in a sauna
[003:30.857][B]: ask for about 500 now and will end up with
[003:35.298][B]: two maybe three billion Android devices any solos
[003:38.768][A]: billion X Factor
[003:41.398][B]: because sometimes the police we talked for a bit in my mouth and use it on a disc while almost same cause that most people have all the things that you can get two more people India or Africa coverage and Phil said to get on Network pricing bills and son
[003:55.354][B]: so you don't have so many people not to call her phone
[003:59.464][B]: 4090 videos about the developer Warranty company for me to talk to you Billy and Two and a Half Men and other people to really spending money and the other half if you're looking at people are spending a total of $5 a month $2 a month $1 a month in buying a 20 $30 fine which is where the market is down
[004:18.114][B]: I'm so the question is what will happen
[004:21.573][A]: right I mean have we seen this play out before in the PC landscape for example and another analogy that we can point to to see where we're headed
[004:30.501][B]: this is a question
[004:33.006][B]: Apple will tell Patty I said there's enough of this document says the biggest ecosystem has gravitational pull of his incision that becomes a self-fulfilling the best guy
[004:55.378][B]: I'm the Professional Collision Cambridge said anything is because you said something will happen
[005:04.008][B]: the Dynamics of the PC industry was so different that is really quite helpful to draw a comparison
[005:11.088][B]: simple addition of the critical period of PC industry
[005:15.036][B]: Mesa Sales with corporate and corporate bonds wanted 1500 generic voices and they will put other people's desks
[005:25.211][B]: didn't really look like they didn't care how easy the user interface was because they were never going to be reconfigured and I'm going to run one app
[005:30.794][B]: and they want you to quit from five vendors in the table I was quite insightful didn't have court at Market fit and I feel when tell date on Microsoft Windows 8
[005:40.020][A]: 
[005:40.461][B]: that's good. By individuals on fit and feel and the user experience and Design
[005:49.122][B]: and then not biological aspects Elizabeth sold on let's show them some of the experiences that some of the space can provide but they don't sell them
[006:00.728][B]: insightful now doesn't make it fit it selling exactly into the kind of buying environment deceitful even doing that yet
[006:10.032][B]: I think that this is an important point and yes it is the specific ecosystem point
[006:15.525][B]: as I said it's a position for the sake of argument that are winner-takes-all dynamics around smoking Maple Credit Systems that work with PC
[006:22.748][B]: that's why everything you said that's where everything is
[006:24.907][B]: Michael's going to have a hundred million years before this time for that effect to kick in
[006:30.000][A]: right
[006:31.658][B]: now imagine you almost expenses or Target or Bank of America or powerful or Aldi
[006:42.984][A]: Walmart Farberware per year in the United States now
[006:46.372][B]: yeah well anyway but anyways hello
[006:48.710][A]: 
[006:48.990][B]: how many days Elijah
[006:52.658][A]: 
[006:53.422][B]: you are powerful in France
[006:56.433][B]: right now you have an Android and an IOS app
[006:59.064][B]: do you have a Windows Phone app
[007:00.602][B]: probably not because there's no when I try and use it in your country and the people and you have a nice time now and it's too small to be with all the way
[007:06.942][B]: you can pull the IOS app for the iPhone app because that's only a third of the scrub device
[007:12.829][A]: 
[007:13.264][B]: you're not even going to pull it if you would talk to coach or even 10% of your subscriber base
[007:17.982][B]: and actually if you look at our value right now it probably three-quarters your boss gets off
[007:24.948][B]: end of the markeisha number doesn't work in quite the same way
[007:32.338][B]: you know when you if you have a software developer 30 years ago when you said right we're going to invest 10 million dollars make an application for Windows
[007:41.141][B]: do e&s invest another five making it for Mac
[007:44.887][B]: and there's no offices none of our Target customers Apple Mac
[007:49.199][B]: don't become completely selfish but if you all as I said a supermarket or Bank told me to change movie cinema theater chain or any other multi-service it feels like it needs to be engage with customers online
[008:03.018][B]: you don't think he's that kind of calculation
[008:05.362][B]: you think I can wear all customers where was the significant number of our costume as one of the touch point where we need to be
[008:11.106][B]: and Windows phone and blackberry a lot of the bottom end of a threat
[008:16.217][B]: but then it is a vicious circle here and also a virtuous circle
[008:19.947][B]: yeah it's extremely hard to kill an ecosystem as long as Parts good in the customers keep buying it
[008:28.664][B]: you know the way that black kid killed if he texts to me too that was fun having up up up. There was no longer competitive
[008:34.890][B]: I'm sure anyone would look at life and said with no competitive product
[008:39.113][B]: mpoints it would cease to be a competitive product if there was ever a stretch
[008:42.668][A]: right
[008:43.485][B]: how do you get the
[008:44.552][A]: you mentioned value and it has been the case for a long time that iOS has to the value of the crew is far more than two Android that ecosystem
[008:54.256][A]: do you see any shift in that and I'll just buy your footprint and War by Google and sometimes catching up with all of those people are using Android caching
[009:03.262][B]: navigate to Patton's
[009:04.610][B]: the couple of ways to look at this
[009:06.447][B]: the first is that consumer behavior is often a shape but self-selection
[009:10.777][B]: that is to say what is the kind of person he is and involves a $600 fine
[009:14.946][B]: what is complication by 200 / 5
[009:17.469][B]: and that's different in different markets in the US you can get a Galaxy S3 for free
[009:23.695][B]: how to patch up look at the price you can get a good Midwife a good mid-range smartphone for free
[009:29.153][B]: I'm so why would you buy $100 modified
[009:32.266][B]: 9500 old small friends people reaction Jenny when he died
[009:36.006][A]: 
[009:36.507][B]: where is in Indonesia somebody $400 money saved up for that and I carry laws
[009:41.373][B]: but then you look at a Western European market is a pretty clear correlation between a 3.5 and a man that interested and engaged in other things you could do them and the People by 11 Fahrenheit
[009:55.473][B]: and when you then look at the Monkey Shadow hand Finds Its off 2/3 week old is only five and the rest goes to find Android phones
[010:04.687][B]: and then you know the problem with looking at all of the following sources is that variables only got the customers
[010:14.206][A]: 
[010:15.262][B]: Android has Old Testament still some good customers and some water and a good customer since I got Grandma he went to the store and said I need a new phone and they gave her $100 Android phone
[010:27.679][B]: and stay within that say you got too much leverage for Android concealed within that you got a big chunk of people here we're having
[010:35.409][A]: 
[010:35.910][B]: but then when you add that up you get to you still get to you know of an actual boss gets on I-20, transactional you know payment right on Android it's all for you see if my right side that says I said it's really just a function of how to make $150
[010:54.500][B]: and you think they have a good class
[010:57.775][A]: and so they're not going to do that the iPhone 5c is this is far down Market as they go
[011:06.470][B]: no I don't think that's true you have to think about how this is going to make the Masa that's what you have to think about the average on the absolute
[011:13.592][B]: I'm about to say this I've been in and what uses salt of my head maybe a hundred million of them have gotten $600 phones
[011:21.894][A]: 
[011:22.413][B]: Anna's going to West Haven
[011:23.737][A]: right
[011:24.649][B]: but if you apply that to the average the average of coffee
[011:27.888][A]: 
[011:28.443][B]: where is Apple is only $600.05 and then we go to 3 times more highly Customer Center Orlando
[011:38.570][B]: do you have to be careful to think about the mass of the average for us if you have salute
[011:42.452][B]: I'm looking at the 5 so I'm kind of analogies get ahold of you but it is kind of useful to think about Apple lesbian ugly man in about two different ways
[011:53.439][B]: Festival BMW does not sell as many cars as Toyota sales on iPads
[011:59.236][B]: they probably don't consider that to be a major extension pole
[012:02.707][A]: 
[012:04.317][B]: man united a lot of my texts in Android land and there's a lot of Lexus is an Android launcher
[012:09.882][A]: 
[012:10.275][B]: and I'm being only care about Lexus but they don't care about the meth heads
[012:14.820][B]: open site to the Port of San Diego it's like with a fun thing about the 5c is like Apple ID made a BMW 7 Series
[012:22.192][B]: yeah I know they make a 5 Series
[012:24.572][B]: the BMW makes an S3 Services LLC - United as one
[012:30.011][B]: they make my pads
[012:31.281][A]: 
[012:31.639][B]: but I do get that they have gone down that progression and maintain the quality level and I think today it would absolutely be possible for apple to make a $300 fine that would be used only on his lunch would be offended they could be proud of
[012:44.089][B]: in much the same way that if you can buy a VW Golf
[012:47.546][B]: you know it's not and ask Mom but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it
[012:51.607][A]: 
[012:51.965][A]: let's talk about this if the service was over the mobile OS War is Over
[012:58.049][A]: divorce shift
[012:59.695][B]: yeah it's all about what happens on top
[013:01.591][A]: it's okay so what does that mean in and who else gets to play in that that landscape
[013:07.102][B]: well this is a big war in a small world this is Smallville Wiki people trying to build something to fill potholes on top of Android which is Amazon and Nokia and has Microsoft in the future
[013:18.446][B]: and in that case it is a lot easier to see what governor solving for themselves and welcome they sell them to the Consumer Price
[013:24.923][B]: the more interesting thing is when you look at what he needs to say small sign on the side of my eyeball internet
[013:31.275][B]: and if you think about how the desktop image that what we will have this conversation where you explain to somebody over the Internet on the web and all the same thing
[013:39.381][B]: but for practical purposes they were
[013:41.599][A]: 
[013:41.903][B]: get a few things like Spotify and Skype around the edges but even 20 years the web the internet in the same thing
[013:48.595][B]: that's okay so maybe
[013:50.510][B]: on the desktop you have the box on the screen and everything happened in that box
[013:56.263][B]: I know the funny thing 15 years ago about people to make that box and Andresen Andresen horse has some opinions about that
[014:05.683][B]: Franklin
[014:09.011][B]: and you got to mobile and Verizon is just one of a dozen different things you could be doing with 2000 different things you could be doing on that device and none of that stuff yet either
[014:17.707][B]: I mean if I was to say that I installed an app on my Android small thing in five years time I didn't want any of those words mean
[014:27.941][B]: I didn't install main causes of weather is it something happening with a new messaging system is it called being delighted Dynamic about your friends system is on hold my phone up to have a menu at a restaurant that we installed
[014:41.468][B]: I don't know what I would need for the same reason
[014:44.027][B]: I did what I knew was going to be in five years time I didn't anybody know and we can meet in five years time and how that interacts with crying and had an interest Google Play services and where the Innovation and they don't even have a bit of interaction with it all that powerful
[014:57.947][B]: medical civil subpoena Walcott about what you mean by that you know we may be sitting here waiting on hands in the air looking at 2 years old looking in a small small crosses
[015:08.056][B]: it seems to be missing in that space is more to the acronym Siri stand for Samsung Galaxy tablet but we really need to be talking about the smokes in the blood as well because of it
[015:17.289][B]: I'm wearing a Swatch smash anyway
[015:21.136][A]: just a little bit on that same to you. do you think that the control goes away from Google and apple not sent it like
[015:34.555][A]: you know if there's all these different players if we don't know who owns the relationship or are you seeing signs of the relationship is a no-sugar shifting I mean Apple certainly has a tight hole but in the Android world
[015:45.774][A]: does Google get to have a relationship or is it something else
[015:49.030][B]: an interesting question about what Google is trying is a Facebook story in here as well of course those are interesting question as to what it is single and act like one too
[015:58.030][B]: nothing inside the system that the people have at least businesses
[016:02.342][B]: is there a she is as much simpler than people think
[016:04.955][B]: Apple makes 3 for $500.04 with a keyboard inside with a great experience
[016:11.342][A]: 
[016:11.808][B]: can I buy an airline so they can replace the inside famous hits with iPad
[016:16.066][A]: 
[016:16.710][B]: TV company looking to buy an air freight business
[016:23.509][B]: they make boxes with such a pathetic and then try to make them the best boxes they possibly can
[016:28.501][A]: 
[016:29.020][B]: and Google is a false Machinery engine it's been 15 years stuffing the stuffing itself with data
[016:35.748][B]: and website is an expression of that just as an expression
[016:42.386][B]: Amazon books company
[016:44.283][B]: some good website is an expression of you but she's not in top form 7 Gmail so it's not so it's now 70 advertising platform that pays for it all but I see what applications that sit on hold
[016:55.627][B]: you did make me a little sad metaphorical sense it will things that sit on top of it on the line machine 1948
[017:01.424][B]: I'm so Google is not her business
[017:04.662][A]: 12 and a half billion dollars later and then selling Motorola again
[017:09.296][B]: because if it was not in the house with cash and then they sold the Cable business
[017:14.414][B]: but yeah I mean that was basically an enormous kind infringement find as much as everything else
[017:19.030][B]: I think just as an apple is not a car company
[017:25.310][B]: well that would show it like to be sometimes but it's only a card company as much as it needs to be a cab company and has a question for the unit coming back to a point about ecosystems
[017:34.489][B]: poison pill for apple is not only having 800 midnight two devices is Google doing something in the car that I have a call into them means you have to buy an Apple device
[017:43.149][B]: but it's hard to see how I feel later to my point about what Google's going to do
[017:47.783][B]: Google is not in a one-to-one fight to the death with Apple
[017:52.919][B]: You could argue it's a one-to-one fight to the death with Facebook or even potentially we have a son but I believe the channel
[018:01.543][B]: if you do go get the jacket is rich rich for the people can use it search and see if I have it I'm using Siri to get information back into the tiny engine and a full size for Google+. Google+ notification that plug on the side and it seems that this page right for the use of the strap
[018:20.491][B]: I'm so sleepy that means the same as I as I said before and it in Google and apple pies one can Google now so basically they want to but they wanted different things
[018:31.638][B]: and everybody that goes out and buys an iPhone is using Google search and Google Maps as long as people said she can go back to good
[018:38.080][B]: Google's problem is making sure that Matt is such a good
[018:41.497][B]: Android phone using Google Maps or Google search when I think that's what the problem is on your body and I thank you but I fancy I feel good and that's happened
[018:50.041][A]: so let's shift gears a little bit and then you mention Facebook but if you are an entrepreneur and somebody wants to insinuate yourself into this ecosystem you know how do you do it these days and then going forward how do you I guess preserve your own leverage and in you know it in the face of this massive footprint by Google and Android and an apple and iOS
[019:15.582][B]: so I think that's the way to think about this one is that a small fine is a richer and more complex and sophisticated powerful than the web and it's also developing a platform in the web I mean we kind of threw it away so I found some big numbers
[019:32.956][B]: they will be as it might be 3 billion for $5 with a massive range of income and calculations on an income of the uses
[019:42.547][A]: MSRP
[019:44.443][B]: yeah I had to leave the whole collection of us left behind
[019:47.735][B]: and that compares with something like 1.5 billion PCS and those pieces of the shed I'm on lockdown at work and then go anyway I don't really portable
[019:58.882][B]: you say you have twice the number of devices those devices other side and they send you everyone's hand all the time as opposed to being in the best school to study or share with your brother or something
[020:10.119][B]: inside the science of the internet gets two or three or four or five times bigger to the consequence of the shift from PC to my boss
[020:17.419][B]: it still baffles me I get blamed for daring to compare a small and sells two pc's how do people think the small things that I can still fill it with water
[020:27.010][A]: 
[020:27.707][B]: UPC the toy that real men meet men trying to go outside and get a small things all of the dominant Computing platform in the dominant internet phone
[020:36.475][B]: a man who completely support PCS in importance and they have a much more very much more complex set of options and opportunities and wise and engaging with users in the pool twice a day to you too and you can see that in a very small way in the application WhatsApp which was like a fantastic case tell you everything is going on online
[020:54.099][B]: one of the things today let's try to discuss how big you can get if you get really lucky with the right idea
[020:59.753][A]: 
[021:00.182][B]: execute very well
[021:01.453][B]: you know 10 years ago not put it another way
[021:05.640][B]: in the time of the first internet bubble United a prototypical Stop Shop and all the time. And you would have a hundred people and you did write 10 million dollars and have a million users
[021:18.397][A]: 
[021:18.916][B]: now
[021:19.703][A]: if you are off to the races
[021:21.493][B]: a new universe 1 million dollars and you have 10 people and you'll have a hundred milliliters
[021:27.021][A]: 
[021:27.433][B]: the whole thing's been completing his head and my father is a big part of that
[021:31.155][B]: I'm sure that someone some point about scale
[021:34.393][B]: I think the second point is we're kind of in a prepaid right face to help people discover and engage stuff online
[021:41.514][B]: not to say an App Store now looks a lot like it looks a lot like y'all who write to you guys
[021:50.156][B]: it sounds like I'm trying to do a comedy routine when I describe this is like that was a website that listed every website their walls and you can scroll through them all
[022:01.196][B]: anyways when there was a new website United like you got it all over to you guys I swear to God you get your Netscape homepage and it would say you know the morning would Arkansas Elementary School his go to website
[022:17.604][B]: I like that was on the front page of your brother with you later to Prosser
[022:22.488][B]: when did FIFA to meet my phone apps
[022:27.695][A]: 
[022:28.107][B]: you know you can drown every app there is but there's a million eyes
[022:32.240][A]: so we haven't
[022:33.457][B]: we haven't moved to the point where we discover I can how do we know what's going on
[022:38.771][B]: and part of that is some sort of manual creation part of it is better search in the ass told him it's a genetic problem for that Apple and Google it go to me
